# Server-Side Application Development

## Basic Architecture of the Server-Side Application:

- **.env:** Contains connection strings for the database (URL for DB connection).
- **.gitignore:** Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git version control.
- **package-lock.json** & **package.json:** Contains project configuration and dependency information.
- **app.ts:** The main file for setting up the server and connecting necessary routes and services.
- **controllers:**
  - **missionsController.ts:** Handles requests related to managing mission data.
  - **robotsController.ts:** Handles requests related to managing robot data.
- **db.connect.ts:** Function to establish a connection with PostgreSQL (using `pg`).
- **db.models.sql:** Contains SQL queries for creating database tables.
- **middleware.ts:** Middleware function for error handling.
- **routes.ts:** Defines the main API request paths and links them to their corresponding handler functions.
- **services.ts:** Contains utility functions and data types.
- **socket.ts:** Service for data exchange via WebSocket.
- **tsconfig.json:** TypeScript configuration file.

## app.ts:

- Imports `express`.
- Sets up two main routes: `/echo` and `/api`.

# Client-Side Application Development

## Basic Architecture:

- **bb8.glb:** 3D model of the BB8 robot.
- **field.glb:** 3D model of a generic field for robot movement.
- **r2d2.glb:** 3D model of the R2D2 robot.
- **robot_1.svg:** Icon for the website tab.
- **App.tsx:** The main component that includes other components.
- **Joystick.tsx:** Component for controlling the robots. It listens to keyboard, mouse, and touch events, processes these events, and sends updated robot coordinates via WebSocket.
- **MissionForm.tsx:** Form for editing or adding a new mission, including selecting a robot.
- **MissionsList.tsx:** Component for displaying mission data.
- **Position.tsx:** Component for displaying the robot's current position.
- **Field.tsx:** Component for loading and rendering the 3D model of the field.
- **Ground.tsx:** Component that renders the canvas and loads all scene elements.
- **BB8.tsx:** Component for rendering the 3D model of the BB8 robot, including a receiver for the robot's position data via WebSocket.
- **R2D2.tsx:** Component for rendering the 3D model of the R2D2 robot, including a receiver for the robot's position data via WebSocket.
- **RobotContext.tsx:** Creates a context for robot data, including state management.
- **WebSocketContext.tsx:** Creates a context for WebSocket data, providing access to its properties and methods.
- **main.tsx:** High-order component that sets up context providers.
- **fetchdata.ts:** Service function for fetching data.
- **movement.ts:** Utility function that calculates the next coordinates of robots based on events.
